Below is a summary of all prompts given during the development process:

2. **"i meant to add text 'bank account'"** – Clarified that the intent was to add a "Bank Account" label next to the account number on each operation card.
3. **"make it 'account number' and unbold it"** – Requested changing the label from "Bank Account" to "Account Number:" and removing the bold styling to make it more subtle.
